# Project Definition: Tourism E-commerce CMS

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the definition for a headless Content Management System (CMS) tailored for a tourism e-commerce platform. The project will leverage Payload CMS, an open-source, TypeScript-first headless CMS, focusing on a modular architecture where core and domain-specific entities (collections) are loaded and managed via a plugin-based approach. Additionally, the CMS will include custom endpoints for monitoring and basic configuration adjustments.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

* To establish a robust and scalable CMS for managing tourism-related e-commerce content.
* To implement a modular architecture using Payload CMS plugins to define and extend collections, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
* To adhere to Payload CMS best practices for configuration, data modeling, security, and plugin development.
* To provide a flexible backend capable of supporting various front-end applications (web, mobile) for booking and Browse tourism products.
* To include custom endpoints for health monitoring and dynamic management of simple configuration settings like feature flags.

## 3. Technology Stack

* **CMS:** Payload CMS
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Framework:** Node.js / Express.js (Underpins Payload)

## 4. Architecture and Design

The project will follow a plugin-oriented architecture within Payload CMS, augmented with custom endpoints.

* **Core Configuration:** The main `payload.config.ts` file will handle fundamental CMS setup, including database connection, authentication, and registration of core plugins.
* **Plugin Development:** Collections and their associated logic (fields, hooks, access control) will be defined within individual Payload CMS plugins. Each plugin will represent a logical grouping of related data or functionality (e.g., a "Products" plugin, a "Bookings" plugin, a "Locations" plugin). Plugins are registered in the core `payload.config.ts` during application initialization.
* **Collection Definition via Plugins:** Plugins will be responsible for introducing new collections into the Payload config by modifying the `collections` array within the plugin's configuration function.
* **Extending Collections via Plugins:** Plugins can also extend existing collections (defined either in the core config or by other plugins) by adding new fields, hooks, or access control logic.
* **Modular Structure:** Each plugin will reside in its own directory, promoting clear separation of concerns.
* **Custom Endpoints:** Specific endpoints will be defined within the Payload configuration to provide additional API functionality outside of the standard auto-generated CRUD endpoints.

## 5. Core Collections (via Plugins)

The following core collections will be defined, each potentially within its own plugin or a set of closely related plugins:

* **Products:** Represents bookable tourism items (tours, activities, packages). Fields will include name, description, pricing, duration, availability, images, and relationships to other relevant collections (e.g., Locations).
* **Orders:** Stores information about customer orders, including items purchased, customer details, payment status, and order history.
* **Users:** Manages different user roles (admin, customer, vendor), authentication details, and user profiles.
* **Media:** Handles image and video uploads related to tourism products and content.
* **Locations:** Defines geographical locations relevant to the tourism offerings (cities, points of interest).

## 6. Tourism-Specific Collections and Extensions (via Plugins)

Plugins will be used to introduce collections and fields specific to the tourism domain and potential e-commerce features:

* **Bookings Plugin:** Could introduce a `Bookings` collection with details about specific customer bookings, dates, and status.
* **Reviews Plugin:** Might add a `Reviews` collection for customer feedback and ratings linked to Products.
* **Amenities Plugin:** Could define an `Amenities` collection and add a relationship field to the Products collection to list available facilities or features.
* **Pricing Tiers Plugin:** Might introduce collections or fields to handle complex pricing structures based on factors like seasonality, group size, or different service levels.
* **Discounts/Promotions Plugin:** Could manage discount codes and promotional offers applicable to products or bookings.

## 7. Core CMS Features

The following Payload CMS features will be implemented to enhance content management capabilities:

### 7.1 Live Preview

Implementation of Live Preview functionality to allow content editors to see changes in real-time before publishing:

* Configure Live Preview for relevant collections like Products and content pages
* Set up preview URLs that connect to the frontend application
* Enable editors to view content changes in the actual frontend context
* Support responsive previews for different device sizes

### 7.2 Content Versioning

Implement comprehensive versioning system to track content changes:

* Enable Draft/Published state management for all content types
* Track version history for all collections
* Allow comparing different versions of content
* Support restoring previous versions
* Implement publishing workflows with scheduled publishing

## 8. Custom Endpoints

The following custom endpoints will be implemented:

* **Health Check Endpoint (`GET /health`):** A simple endpoint to report the status of the CMS and its critical dependencies, primarily the database connection. This is crucial for monitoring and deployment health checks.
* **Configuration Endpoint (`PATCH /config`):** An endpoint designed to allow authorized users to modify simple configuration settings, such as feature flags. This endpoint will interact with a dedicated configuration storage mechanism within Payload (e.g., a Global).

**Note on Plugin Installation Endpoint:** While an endpoint for managing simple configurations like feature flags is included, dynamically installing new plugin code via an endpoint at runtime is not the intended approach for this project due to the complexities and potential risks involved. Modularity is achieved by defining and enabling plugins in the build-time configuration.

## 9. Configuration Management (Feature Flags)

Feature flags and other simple configuration settings will be managed using a Payload Global (e.g., a `FeatureFlags` global). The Configuration Endpoint will update this Global using Payload's local API. The application logic will read the state of feature flags from this Global to enable or disable features.

## 10. Good Practices in Payload CMS Development

Throughout the project, the following Payload CMS best practices will be adhered to:

* **Code-First Configuration:** All CMS configuration, including collections, fields, access control, and endpoints, will be defined in TypeScript code for versionability and maintainability.
* **TypeScript:** Leverage TypeScript for strong typing and improved code quality.
* **Access Control:** Implement fine-grained access control functions for all collections, fields, and custom endpoints to ensure data security based on user roles.
* **Field-Level Configuration:** Utilize Payload's rich field types and options for data validation and structure.
* **Hooks:** Employ hooks (beforeChange, afterChange, etc.) for custom logic, data transformation, and side effects.
* **Custom Endpoints:** Define custom endpoints explicitly for functionalities not covered by standard CRUD operations, ensuring they are well-defined and secure.
* **Plugin Reusability:** Design plugins to be as self-contained and reusable as possible.
* **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for sensitive information and core configuration settings.
* **Validation:** Implement server-side validation for all incoming data, especially for data submitted to custom endpoints.
* **Testing:** Although not explicitly detailed in this definition, unit and integration tests should be considered for plugins, custom endpoints, and core logic.

## 11. Deployment Considerations

The deployment strategy will follow Payload CMS recommendations, considering factors like:

* Database hosting (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, managed PostgreSQL).
* File storage (e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage).
* Environment variable management.
* Scalability and performance.
* Monitoring the health check endpoint.

## 12. Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements could include:

* Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe plugin).
* Internationalization and localization of content.
* Advanced search capabilities.
* Integration with third-party tourism APIs.

This project definition provides a high-level overview of the planned Tourism E-commerce CMS using Payload CMS with a strong emphasis on a plugin-based architecture for defining and extending collections and the inclusion of custom endpoints for monitoring and configuration, all while adhering to good practices.
