# Feature Implementation Process

When implementing a new feature, follow this thought process:

1. **FIRST: Review Existing Demos in websitePayload**
   - Look for similar features already implemented in the `/home/node/websitePayload` project
   - Study the implementation patterns, component structure, and API usage
   - Understand how the feature integrates with the rest of the application

2. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Break down the feature requirements
   - Identify the components needed
   - Map out data flow and state management

3. **Plan Implementation**
   - Determine which existing components can be reused
   - Identify new components to be created
   - Plan API integration strategy

4. **Implement Following Project Patterns**
   - Follow the same coding style, patterns, and architecture
   - Maintain consistency with existing features
   - Reuse existing utilities and helpers

5. **Test and Validate**
   - Ensure functionality works as expected
   - Verify integration with existing systems
   - Check for edge cases

Always start by examining how similar features are implemented in the websitePayload project before writing new code. This ensures consistency and leverages existing solutions.
